== Introduction

== Module, Namespace and ... what else?
Starting developing in `node.js` one of the first thing I have met was the `require` keyword used to load a module. Then when I moved to a bit more advanced JavaScript I have met the Revealing Module Pattern, later on with TypeScript I have read about concepts like modules and namespaces.

I am really a bit confusing about what they are and when I should use them, so I will try to find explanation step by step.

=== What is a module and why use modules
TIP: *Definition:* a module is a way to encapsulate some piece of code into a unit. The unit can be used by other modules and applications.
